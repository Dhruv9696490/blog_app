Built a new Flutter application!
I’ve been working on a Flutter app following Clean Architecture and SOLID principles, focusing on scalability and maintainability.
Tech stack & architecture highlights:
● Flutter (Dart)
● Clean Architecture
● SOLID principles
● BLoC State Management
● Supabase for authentication & storing user blogs
● Hive for local storage
This project helped me deepen my understanding of Clean architecture, state management, and real-world app structure.
